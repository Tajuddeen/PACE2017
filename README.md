# PACE
A step-by-step Keras implementation of PACE (Preference And Context Embedding) described in our KDD 2017 paper. To run the code, you need to have Python 3 and iPython Notebook installed.

Please cite the following work.

## Usage:
* Use `bash download_data.sh` to download the Gowalla data or visit Yelp to download the Yelp data.
* Run `python3 dataset.py` for data preprocessing (slight modifications needed to match specific data formats).
* Start iPython Notebook Server `ipython3 notebook`
* Sequentially run cells in `train.ipynb`

If you are using remote machine, you can:
* Start iPython Notebook Server on remote machine: `ipython notebook --no-browser --port=8889`
* Redirect ssh connection to localhost `ssh -N -f -L localhost:8880:localhost:8889 <user>@<host>`
* Open browser and go to `<user>@<host>:8880`
